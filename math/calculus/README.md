# Calculus

> Calculus is an important field in mathematics and it plays an integral role in many machine learning algorithms. If you want to understand what’s going on under the hood in your machine learning work as a data scientist, you’ll need to have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of calculus. This project covers the first part of calculus that covers concepts for algorithms such as the gradient descent algorithm and backpropagation to train deep learning neural networks implementation with Python for machine learning.
