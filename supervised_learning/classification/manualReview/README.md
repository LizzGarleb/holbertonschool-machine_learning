## Overview
The **Manual Review** folder in this project is dedicated to tasks that require manual testing and evaluation to assess and award points. It contains a combination of image resources (stored in the **img** directory) and test cases or guidelines (located in the **test** directory) to facilitate the manual review process.

## Contents

Inside the **Manual Review** folder, you will find the following components:

- **Images (img)**: This directory contains images, screenshots, or visual representations related to the tasks that need manual evaluation. These images provide context and visual information to reviewers.

- **Test Guidelines (test)**: In this directory, you can find detailed test cases, instructions, or evaluation criteria that reviewers should follow when manually assessing the tasks. These guidelines are essential for maintaining consistency and fairness in the review process.
